This is a small modification to Seung Woo Shin's XDebug remote debugger.  For further instructions, see here: http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=1152

The only thing I added is the ability to set path mapping in your .vimrc (or wherever)

For example:
let pathMap="/mnt/hgfs:/home/ethanm/vmfiles, /home/config:/home/ethanm/config"
would adjust my xdebug paths so that I could now work with a local editor on files running in my VM.
